## Activation Functions in C++ for Neural Networks
This repository contains an implementation of various activation functions used in machine learning and neural networks. The purpose of this project is to help others learn the fundamentals of activation functions and how to structure code for scalability and maintainability. The code is designed using Object-Oriented Programming principles and the Factory design pattern, making it easy to add new activation functions in the future.

## Overview
Activation functions are a crucial part of neural networks, enabling non-linear transformations to the input data and allowing the network to learn complex patterns. This project provides an implementation of several popular activation functions in C++ including:

Sigmoid
ReLU
Tanh
Each activation function is implemented as a separate class, and they all follow a common interface. The system uses the Factory design pattern to manage the creation of these activation functions, ensuring that the code remains scalable and easy to extend.

## Design and Architecture
The design of this project follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure clarity, modularity, and reusability. The architecture is composed of the following components:

## 1. ActivationFunction Interface
Purpose: Defines a common interface for all activation functions. Each function must implement the compute() method.
Benefits: Ensures that all activation functions can be used interchangeably.
## 2. Concrete Activation Function Classes
Purpose: Implements specific activation functions such as Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh.
Benefits: Each class is isolated from others, making the system modular and easy to expand with additional activation functions.
## 3. ActivationFunctionFactory
Purpose: Uses the Factory design pattern to create instances of activation functions dynamically based on the function name.
Benefits: Easily add new functions without modifying existing code.
## 4. Main Program
Purpose: Demonstrates how to use the system to create and apply activation functions.
Benefits: Provides a simple entry point for testing and interacting with the activation functions.


## Code Explanation
# 1. ActivationFunction Interface
The ActivationFunction class is an abstract base class that defines a compute() method for calculating the output of the activation function. Each derived class implements this method with the specific logic for its function.

# 2. Factory Pattern
The Factory Design Pattern is used in the ActivationFunctionFactory class. It registers activation functions by name and allows them to be created dynamically using the create() method. This allows new activation functions to be added without changing the main codebase.

# 3. Memory Management
The code uses std::unique_ptr for managing memory automatically, ensuring there are no memory leaks or dangling pointers.

## Key Design Patterns
# 1. Factory Design Pattern
What it is: The Factory pattern allows for the dynamic creation of objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.
Why it's used: In this project, it is used to dynamically create different activation functions based on the function's name. This promotes flexibility and scalability.
# 2. Strategy Pattern (Implicitly)
What it is: The Strategy pattern is used when a class needs to choose an algorithm or behavior from a family of algorithms at runtime.
Why it's used: Each activation function is a different "strategy" for processing data. The ActivationFunction interface defines a common strategy, and each derived class implements its own version.


## Questions to Consider During Implementation
When implementing this code, it's important to consider the following questions:

1. Which activation functions should be implemented?
2. How should input validation be handled?
3. How should the system be extended to support multi-dimensional inputs (e.g., vectors or matrices)?
4. How do you ensure that the system is scalable?
5. What are the memory and performance considerations when working with large datasets?
6. How would you test the activation functions?
